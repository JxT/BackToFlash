BackToFlash
===========

A Safari extension that disables YouTube's HTML5 player, which can be used in conjunction with other extensions such as ClickToPlugin


<h2>Why re-enable Flash?</h2>
As someone who loves the ClickToPlugin extension by Marc Hoyois, which allows Safari users to replace YouTube's video player (among others) with a native QuickTime player, I was gutted when YouTube started to use the HTML5 player by default, with no opt-out.

That's why I made this plugin - to re-enable Flash so we can disable it and replace it with the faster and less CPU-hogging native player.

<h2>Do you offer any kind of support?</h2>
Not really, no. ;)
I made this as a kind of pet project, and am not going to be spending anytime debugging if at some point YouTube changes again, and it breaks.
